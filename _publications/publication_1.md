This paper presents a comprehensive approach to automated performance assessment in smart learning environments through IoT-based activity recognition and semantic evaluation systems. The research contributes to the advancement of intelligent educational technology by providing real-time assessment capabilities that enhance learning outcomes and educational effectiveness.

**Key Contributions:**
- Development of IoT-based activity recognition system for educational environments
- Implementation of semantic evaluation framework for automated performance assessment  
- Integration of hardware and software components for comprehensive learning analytics
- Validation of the system in real-world smart learning environment scenarios

**Technical Approach:**
The system leverages Internet of Things sensors to capture learner activities and behaviors, processes this data through advanced activity recognition algorithms, and applies semantic evaluation techniques to provide meaningful performance assessments. This automated approach reduces manual assessment overhead while providing more consistent and objective evaluation metrics.
